    <h2>What is Mountain Pose?</h2>
    <p>
        Mountain Pose is a standing pose that emphasizes grounding and
        stability. It is often the starting position for many standing asanas
        and acts as a powerful reminder of the importance of alignment and
        breath. In this pose, you stand tall and proud, like a mountain, rooted
        firmly to the earth.

    <h2>How to Practice Mountain Pose</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Stand Tall:</strong> Begin by standing with your feet together
            or hip-width apart, depending on your comfort level. Distribute your
            weight evenly across both feet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ground Your Feet:</strong> Press down through the four corners
            of your feet—big toe, little toe, inner heel, and outer heel. Feel the
            connection with the earth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Engage Your Legs:</strong> Slightly lift your knee caps and engage
            your thighs without locking your knees. Imagine drawing energy up from
            the ground through your legs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Align Your Spine:</strong> Lengthen your spine by imagining a
            string pulling the crown of your head upward. Relax your shoulders down
            and back, opening your chest.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Position Your Arms:</strong> Let your arms rest by your sides
            with palms facing forward, or raise them overhead, fingers extended,
            if you prefer a more active stance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breathe Deeply:</strong> Close your eyes if comfortable, and
            take several deep breaths, focusing on the rise and fall of your chest
            and the sensations in your body.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Overarching the Lower Back:</strong> Keep a neutral spine to
            avoid compression in the lower back.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Locking the Knees:</strong> Engage your thighs to maintain a
            soft bend in the knees.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shrugging Shoulders:</strong> Keep your shoulders relaxed and
            away from your ears.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Incorporating Mountain Pose into Your Routine</h2>
    <p>
        Mountain Pose can be practiced independently or integrated into your
        yoga flow. Start your sessions with Tadasana to ground yourself before
        moving into other postures. Use it as a transition pose between
        sequences, or even as a moment of pause during your day to reconnect
        with your breath and body.

        significance in yoga practice cannot be understated. By embracing
        Tadasana, you cultivate a sense of balance, strength, and mindfulness
        that enriches your yoga journey and daily life. So, next time you step
